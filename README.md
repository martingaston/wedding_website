# :tada: Our wedding website :couple_with_heart:

Some of our best friends have been getting married this year, so it's safe to say we've seen some really nice wedding websites - so when it was _our_ turn to tie the knot I wanted to have a go at putting something together. As this is sort of being designed independently of our paper invitations and some of the other things we'll be putting together, the decision was that we wanted it to look relatively classic and semi-formal.

For some reason I also happen to be really into serif fonts at the moment.

And bananas.

This was also a learning project for me to understand React. I'd quite like to refactor it over the next few weeks to make more use of components (particuarly with CSS-in-JS libraries, notably Emotion) and also to further poke under the hood to get a greater understanding of how Gatsby and Webpack use the cache - I'm interested in PWA's in general right now, so there's lots of good stuff here.

More than happy to be on the recieving end of any tips regarding best practice or other optimisations :ok_hand:
