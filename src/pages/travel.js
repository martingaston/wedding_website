            Unless you're brave or close enough to take to the roads, you start
            by booking a flight into Boston's Logan International Airport.
            Boston is served by American, Delta, Southwest, United and JetBlue.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, you can either rent a car and drive straight to the Cape
            (about 90 min) OR get the Plymouth &amp; Brockton bus from the
            airport to Hyannis or Barnstable and request a ride from there (Uber
            and Lyft do exist on the Cape, just not in massive quantities). The
            Langsen family has taken a lot of those buses over the years and
            this is a good option if you're coordinating with a larger group
            with a car arriving at a different time.

            Flights from London to Boston Logan Airport include Virgin Atlantic
            from Heathrow and Norweigan from Gatwick, though we'd recommend the
            former over the latter. You can rent a car to travel from Logan to
            Cape Cod, or alternatively ride the{" "}
            <a href="https://www.p-b.com/">
              <em>Plymouth &amp; Brockton Street Railway Co</em>
            </a>{" "}
            which we'd call a bus.

            Those travelling to the US from the UK will need a valid ESTA, which
            can be{" "}
            <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">applied for online</a> and
            costs $14 (about Â£11). These are pretty quick to process so we'd
            recommend you fill in the form about a month before your flight.
            It's all electronic so you won't need to print anything out.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll need to fill out a landing card (which will be handed out on
            your flight) so it's usually a pretty good idea to pack a pen in
            your carry on luggage. Also, people who carry a pen always look
            smart.

            May 27 also happens to be{" "}

            </a>{" "}
            in the US, which is a federal holiday. Americans do not get a great
            deal of public holidays so this is quite a big occasion.
